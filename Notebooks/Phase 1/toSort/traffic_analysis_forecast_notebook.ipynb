    "Performance Analysis: The traffic jam severity performance on roads A50 and A2 has shown variability. This could be attributed to various factors such as time of the day, day of the week, accidents, roadworks, or other unforeseen incidents.\n",

    "Recommendation: It is essential to delve deeper into the reasons for the fluctuations in traffic jam severity. Investigating specific incidents, roadworks schedules, and other external challenges can provide insights. For days where severe traffic jams are forecasted, it would be wise for commuters to consider alternative routes or modes of transport.\n",
